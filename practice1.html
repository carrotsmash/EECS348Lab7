Create a profile page that is styled with CSS. Have fun with this! In your profile, you must include
your name, a photo, and contact info. You can also showcase anything good for your professional
career, e.g., courses, projects, and work experience. You can also use JS and PHP in this practice. At
the same time, you must include at least one link and video. -->
